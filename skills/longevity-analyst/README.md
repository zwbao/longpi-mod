# longevity-analyst

![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-0.6.0-CC785C)

Agent skill that turns one person's longevity test data into a multi-omics report, a digital-twin snapshot and an
evidence-cited intervention plan. It runs local nf-core pipelines only after a preflight check and the user's consent.

Router-shaped: `SKILL.md` indexes seven stage workflows under `workflows/`; `scripts/la.py` is the harness that owns
state, gates and number binding.
