# AI4L Quality Assurance Guideline for Evidence Reviews

Full lines encapsulated in `   ` are treated as comments for the auditor and are not executed or included in any resulting document. They are hints and instructions for the auditor only.

`The entire Introduction, Globals & Audit Instructions block is not part of the final audit document.`

## Introduction

Evidence reviews are well-structured, high-quality, evidence-based reviews of health and longevity interventions

This document defines the quality assurance (QA) audit process for an "Evidence Review" (ER). It contains both instructions for an auditor and a structured list of the items to be audited.

It not only allows an auditor to evaluate the quality of an ER but also guides authors in creating ERs, since the QA implicitly defines the requirements for such documents.


## Globals

* Set [total_items] to 448 (which is the number of all checklist items)

* Set [review_filename] to the filename of the review to be audited
* Set [review_canonical_topic] to the canonical_topic as stated in the frontmatter of the review to be audited

* Set [prompt_version] to the version stated at the start of this document

* Set [audit_date] to the date of the audit with a format of "YYYY-MMDD-HHMM" (e.g., 2026-0501-1430)
* Set [audit_ai_fullname] to the full name of the model that is running in this session, including its version, but no additional qualifiers. (e.g., Opus 4.7, Sonnet 4, Grok 4.1, Gemini 3, ChatGPT 5.5)
* Set [audit_ai_nickname] to the name of the AI model reduced to a single word without version, etc. (e.g., Opus, Sonnet, Grok, Gemini, GPT)

* Set [audit_filename] by performing a literal string substitution on [review_filename]. Replace "_ER.md" with "_ER_QA_[audit_date].md".
  - E.g., `Intervention_2026-0303-1455_MODEL_ER.md` becomes `Intervention_2026-0303-1455_MODEL_ER_QA_2026-0303-1455.md`
  - DO NOT forget the ".md" extension
  - DO NOT change anything else in the filename except the specified substitution


## Auditor Instructions

The following rules govern how this checklist must be used when performing an audit:


### The intervention may be a combination

[intervention] is whatever the ER's topic names — a single agent, or a combination of two or more agents given together (e.g., "PDE5 Inhibitors & Statins", "Ivermectin, Mebendazole & Fenbendazole").

Where the topic names a combination, the combination is the intervention. It is the unit of analysis for every section: benefits, risks, mechanism, protocol, monitoring and conclusion are about the agents given together, not about each agent separately. An ER that reviews the agents one by one and never addresses their joint use fails the sections it splits.

Two consequences for the auditor:

* When an item cites a trial of a single agent, check that the ER says so and names the agent (16.35 / 18.34). An effect established for one agent — benefit or risk — is delivered by the combination and keeps its grade, since taking the combination means taking that agent. What needs evidence on the two together is the claim that the combination does more, or harms more, than either agent alone.
* Effects arising only from co-administration — a shared metabolic pathway, overlapping half-lives, additive effect on a shared target — belong to the intervention itself (14.7, 18.1), not to Key Interactions (section 20), which covers what the intervention interacts with outside itself.


### Start Fresh

* DO NOT use or take into account any prior audit's results in any way in relation to this audit. Every audit must be performed independently. The prior audit may have missed issues or made mistakes. Each iteration must be a fully independent, item-by-item audit.

* DO NOT use or access any other documents besides this one and the ER in question

* DO NOT take any shortcuts to optimize token usage or cut processing time. The goal is thoroughness, not token optimization.

### Handling limitations

* Read all files that you have to access in chunks of 250 lines or fewer, starting from the top. Do not read a file in one go if it exceeds 250 lines.

### No Sub-agents

An auditing AI should not use sub-agents for tasks in the audit process (e.g., the 5-step process). Often, not all knowledge is passed to or available to sub-agents; they can lose context and become confused.

* DO NOT use sub-agents for any tasks in the audit process.
* DO everything yourself.
* DO things sequentially.

### Temporary files

* All temporary files created during the audit process must be stored in [tmp_dir]

### Do not fix any issues during the audit

* DO NOT fix any issues found during the audit.
* Auditing and fixing are separate operations.
* Your mode is audit-only.

### Use Unicode for emojis

When inserting emojis, always use the corresponding Unicode, not the short code
E.g., 🟢 (Unicode) instead of ":green_circle:", 🔴 (Unicode) instead of ":red_circle:"


### Formatting of checklist items and sections

In the document resulting from this audit, the individual sections of the checklist should be structured as tables with the following format.

| # | Description | Result | Comments |
|---|-------------|:------:|----------|

Each section gets its own table. The table and the column titles should be exactly as given above.


### Processing the checklist

Process the checklist section by section, in order.

For each section:

1. Identify every item (looking like "* x.y \<description>") in the section. Count them.
2. Create one table row for each item. Do not skip any, even short conditional items like "If none of the above..." or "If the section is not applicable...".
3. After completing the table for that section, verify that the number of rows in your table must equal the number of items you counted in step 1. If it does not, find and add the missing item(s) before moving to the next section.

Every item in a checklist section must produce exactly one row. No more, no less.

Do not add, invent, or infer checklist items that are not explicitly listed in this document. Only the items written below as "* x.y \<description> " are checklist items. If something is not listed, it is not checked.


#### "#" column

Items are pre-numbered in this document with the format "<section#>.<item#>" (e.g., 2.1, 2.2, ...). Use these exact numbers in the "#" column of the audit table.


#### Description column

Do not abbreviate, shorten, or reformulate any checklist items when creating the audit document. Use them as they are for the description column.


#### Result column

Each result is either "pass", "fail", or "N/A". There is no "partial pass" or "borderline." If an item is not fully satisfied, it is "fail".

Use 🟢 for "pass" and 🔴 for "fail".
DO NOT use text for these two.
For "N/A", use the actual text "N/A".


#### N/A definition

Mark an item N/A only when the checklist item contains an explicit condition that does not apply to the document under audit. Specifically, N/A is permitted only for items phrased as "If \<condition>..." where the condition is factually not met. Examples:

* "If an article exists, a direct link is provided" → N/A when no article exists
* "If no article exists, clearly states not found" → N/A when an article does exist
* "If the section does not apply, briefly mention this" → N/A when the section does apply
* "For supplements, addresses third-party testing" → N/A when the intervention is not a supplement

N/A must never be used for items that the document failed to address, did poorly, or where the auditor is uncertain. Those are fails.


#### Comment column

Every item marked as failed must include a specific comment stating what is wrong and where in the review (line number or section name).


### 5-Step audit process

To avoid hallucinations and calculation errors, break down the audit process into 5 steps:

#### 1. Table generation

* First, only expand the numbered sections and items into the table format
* Copy each item description verbatim. DO NOT abbreviate, rephrase, or summarize items

* DO NOTHING else
* DO NOT audit items
* DO NOT fill in results
* DO NOT calculate the pass rate
* DO NOT generate comments

* Count the total number of items in the tables

* If it differs from [total_items]
  - Report the fact and the reason
  - STOP the audit process

* Save the result as a new file named "[audit_filename]" in [creation_dir]
* If possible, display a download link for the user to save the file; otherwise,
  - Display the full result (with all tables included, not a partial file), so it can be copied


#### 2. URL Verification

* Scan the whole document and list all links of the ER in the `## URL Verification` table
* Ignore internal links and links to the AI4L repository
* Use the standard markdown notation for the `Link` column
* When creating the list copy the link title verbatim, excactly as it appears in the document

* After creating the list, for each entry:

  - Mark the `Loaded` column either 🟢 or 🔴

  - Mark the `Match` column either 🟢 or 🔴

  - In `Verified By` use exactly one of these values, spelled exactly as written: `d-clinicaltrialsgov`, `d-pubmed`, `d-browser`, `d-fetch`, `d-proxy-1`, `d-proxy-2`, or `none`. NEVER invent a variant spelling, a tool name not in this list, or a combination of them.

  - For PubMed links, use `d-pubmed` (`pubmed_fetch_articles`) first. If the PMID resolves and the returned title matches the ER's claim, mark `Loaded` 🟢 and `Verified By` `d-pubmed`. Only if the PMID does not resolve, fall back to the chain below.

  - For ClinicalTrials.gov links, use `d-clinicaltrialsgov` (`clinicaltrials_get_study_record`) first. If the NCT ID resolves and the study title matches the ER's claim, mark `Loaded` 🟢 and `Verified By` `d-clinicaltrialsgov`. Only if the NCT ID does not resolve, fall back to the chain below.

  - Try to retrieve the url using `d-browser`. If `d-browser` fails, try `d-fetch`. If `d-fetch` also fails, then, if available, try `d-proxy-1`, and if that also fails, `d-proxy-2`. These are bot-wall-defeating retrieval tiers; use whichever page-retrieval tool that server offers. An archive or cache is NOT a retrieval tier and can never satisfy this item.

  - Loading has failed unless you are holding the genuine target page. A transport error, an error page (404, 500, …), or a bot-detection interstitial (CAPTCHA, "Security Checkpoint", "Verify your browser") are all failures.

  - If every tier fails, mark `Loaded` 🔴, `Verified By` `none`, and `Match` 🔴. Always comment on what happened.

  - If the page was retrieved, confirm that the content matches the link's title. If it does, mark the item in the `Match` column as passed with 🟢. If it does not, or the content is behind a paywall, mark it as failed with 🔴 in the `Match` column and add a comment in the `Comment` column about the mismatch or the paywall.

* Summarized Outcomes

| Outcome                                                                       | Loaded | Match |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ | ----- |
| genuine page, content matches                                                 | 🟢     | 🟢    |
| genuine page, wrong content                                                   | 🟢     | 🔴    |
| genuine page, content paywalled                                               | 🟢     | 🔴    |
| 404 / 410 / parked / redirect to unrelated                                    | 🔴     | 🔴    |
| bot wall / CAPTCHA / checkpoint / anti-bot 403                                | 🔴     | 🔴    |


#### 3. Audit

* Now do the actual audit
* Carefully examine each section and item, ensuring all requirements are met, and any potential issues are addressed

* DO NOT add any checklist items
* DO NOT add any table rows or columns
* DO NOT add any extra tables
* DO NOT count items or calculate the pass rate

* Save the result by overwriting "[audit_filename]" in [creation_dir]
* If possible, display a download link for the user to save the file; otherwise,
  - Display the full result (with all tables included, not a partial file), so it can be copied


#### 4. Counting

* Store your scripts in [tmp_dir]
* Write and run a script that parses the result of step 3 and counts "Items", 🟢, 🔴, and "N/A".

* Calculate [pass_rate] = [passed] / ([passed] + [failed]) × 100, always formatted to exactly 2 decimal places followed by % (e.g. `100.00%`, `85.71%`)
* N/A items are excluded from both the numerator and the denominator.

* DO NOT attempt to count or do arithmetic manually
* DO NOT add any extra tables
* DO NOT remove, summarize, or replace the individual items or tables; they must all remain in the final file

* Use the Step 3 result
* Fill out the summary table at the beginning of the audit

* If "Items" differs from [total_items]
  - Report the fact and the reason
  - STOP the audit process

* Save the result by overwriting "[audit_filename]";
* If possible, display a download link for the user to save the file; otherwise,
  - Display the full result (with all tables included, not a partial file), so it can be copied


#### 5. Documentation

* Document all the issues you found during the audit in the `## Issues` section at the end of the document.

* If the [pass_rate] is 100.00% {
  * Write in the `## Issues` section `Pass rate 100.00%. No issues found.`
}

* Issue entry format: Use a numbered list
* Each entry starts with the checklist item number and a short label (3-6 words) in bold, followed by a colon, then the description in normal weight.
* Format:  "1. **{item#} — {short label}:** {What is wrong and where, with specific line numbers or quotes. 1-2 sentences max.}"
* If one issue covers multiple checklist items, combine the numbers: "**6.1 / 6.10 — {short label}:**"

* Example: "1. **7.5 — PMC link instead of PubMed:** The Johnston et al. 2006 paper in Recommended Reading uses a PMC link instead of the required PubMed format."
* Example: "2. **6.1 / 6.10 — RCT not expanded at first use:** "RCT" first appears at line 106 without expansion; it is only expanded later at line 183."

* Always end the whole document with two blank lines


### Source-of-truth fields are immutable

The frontmatter of the ER contains a one-way derivation chain rooted in the topic:

[topic] → [intervention] → [canonical_name] → [canonical_topic] / [short_topic] /
[short_topic_lc]

* [intervention] is derived solely from [topic] (rule 6.7) and is the source of truth for the
intervention identity. It MUST NOT be modified to resolve any finding.

* When a finding involves a mismatch between [intervention] and a downstream field — e.g.,
[canonical_name] expanding [intervention] in violation of rule 6.10 — the only valid remedy is to
rewrite the downstream field. Rewriting [intervention] to match a corrupted downstream field
corrupts the input chain and is never a valid fix.


### Hints for the auditor

If necessary, hints for the auditor in the actual checklist are formatted `like this` and must not be part of the resulting document.

`List of checklist items grouped in sections starts here.`


## 1. Focus, Tone & Audience

* 1.1 The focus of the document is to present the evidence for and against applying the intervention in question, with the stated goal

* 1.2 The focus of the document is primarily on the effectiveness of the intervention, not cost. Cost is secondary at most

* 1.3 The document does not jump to conclusions prematurely; it builds its case through evidence

* 1.4 The tone of the document is simultaneously expert, accessible, objective, and data-driven, but also empowering and encouraging

* 1.5 The document reads as a trusted, knowledgeable guide rather than a prescriptive doctor

* 1.6 The document avoids language that implies medical or clinical advice

* 1.7 The document "presents information" instead of "providing guidance", "recommending", or "advising"

* 1.8 The document never addresses "the reader" directly — it presents evidence, not guidance

* 1.9 Content is written in plain language, avoiding unnecessary medical jargon

`A term is "unnecessary" when a plain-language word would carry the same precision; where a specialist term is the only precise option it is kept and explained at first use. Entry and summary surfaces hold to a stricter plain-language bar — see (Motivation) and (Conclusion).`

* 1.10 Information is presented in a concise and very compact manner

* 1.11 When presenting multiple aspects, bullet points are used to enhance clarity and readability

* 1.12 The target audience is health- and longevity-oriented adults who are risk-aware, proactive, and actively seeking to optimize health or apply the intervention under review.

* 1.13 The target audience is willing to employ lifestyle and behavioral changes as well as follow protocols that may be inconvenient, costly, or require effort.

* 1.14 The document is NOT written for the general population, who are unwilling to employ lifestyle and behavioral changes or follow protocols that may be inconvenient, costly, or require effort.

* 1.15 Framing, takeaways, and risk/benefit weighting throughout the document reflect this audience, including where an intervention's signal for the average person differs from its signal for this audience.

* 1.16 The document's own voice frames usage in **longevity** terms, not "anti-aging" (e.g., "anti-aging clinics", "anti-aging community", "anti-aging medicine"). Proper names that contain "anti-aging" (e.g., "American Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine") are quoted verbatim.

* 1.17 The document's own voice uses formal clinical and scientific terminology, not colloquial or consumer-grade language (e.g., "oral medication" not "pill(s)"; "oral" / "administered orally" not "taken by mouth" / "given by mouth"; "injection" not "shot"; "adverse event" not "bad reaction"). This holds on EVERY surface, including Motivation and Conclusion — the stricter plain-language bar there (see 1.9) does not license lay phrasing for route of administration. Direct quotes from sources are exempt.


## 2. Handling of Scientific Evidence

* 2.1 When available, conclusions are based on high-quality human clinical trials, such as randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses.

* 2.2 Observational studies, mechanistic data, and expert opinion from researchers and reputable physicians with practical experience, utilizing their books, blog posts, podcasts, and presentations, are used to provide context and fill in gaps where clinical data is lacking.

* 2.3 It is stated clearly when high-quality evidence is conflicting or inconclusive (e.g., two large RCTs show different outcomes).

* 2.4 If evidence is conflicting or inconclusive, different viewpoints or study outcomes are presented, and the potential reasons for the discrepancy, if known (e.g., differences in study design, population, dosage, or duration), are explained

* 2.5 When a researcher's work is central to the topic, their primary sources (original publications, books, data) are examined directly — not solely through the lens of later critiques or dismissals

* 2.6 Claims that prior research has been "debunked," "discredited," or "disproven" are treated as assertions that themselves require evidence. The critique is evaluated, not repeated as fact

* 2.7 The document does not adopt any professional establishment's consensus position as the default truth. Mainstream and dissenting positions are both presented as claims supported (or not) by evidence.

* 2.8 When the body of available evidence is produced primarily by parties with a direct financial interest in the intervention's adoption or rejection (e.g., professional associations whose members perform the procedure, pharmaceutical manufacturers, device makers), this conflict of interest is identified and named at first citation and again in the Conclusion.

* 2.9 When competing interventions differ substantially in cost, the ER identifies whether institutional payers (insurers, national health systems) have a systematic financial incentive to favor one over the other, and notes this as a potential source of structural bias in guideline formation and research funding.

* 2.10 When a professional or advocacy organization is cited as a primary source of evidence or guidelines, the ER notes whether that organization's membership derives direct revenue from the conclusions it endorses — immediately adjacent to where the organization's position or advocacy is stated (not merely at its introduction or first mention), and again in the Conclusion. This applies symmetrically to all cited parties on all sides of the debate.

* 2.11 Content is framed for the target audience (see 1.12), not as population-level outcomes.

* 2.12 A finding attributed to a specific paper, or to a body of reviews (e.g., "Cochrane reviews of X show…"), carries a link to that paper, or to one of those reviews.


## 3. General Formatting

* 3.1 The document is output as a Markdown file (.md)

* 3.2 All section headings use H2 formatting

* 3.3 An extra blank line (two spaces + carriage return) appears before each section heading

* 3.4 Every list (bulleted or numbered) is preceded by a blank line

* 3.5 New lines are created using two spaces and a carriage return

* 3.6 Emojis are always encoded using the corresponding Unicode, not the short code. e.g., 🟢 (Unicode) instead of ":green_circle:", 🔴 (Unicode) instead of ":red_circle:"

* 3.7 The document contains no unrendered AI-internal markup (e.g., citation tokens, reference IDs, source tags, or debug metadata)

* 3.8 Scientific nomenclature and technical symbols follow their field conventions everywhere in the document — in frontmatter fields, headings, body text, tables, and captions.

* 3.9 These conventions override "Chicago Manual of Style" (CMS) where they conflict

* 3.10 Binomial species names: genus is capitalized, species epithet is lowercase. Examples: "Lactobacillus acidophilus" not "Lactobacillus Acidophilus"; "Ginkgo biloba"; "Rhodiola rosea"; "Tribulus terrestris"; "Bifidobacterium lactis"; "Curcuma longa". This applies inside longer phrases too ("Ginkgo biloba extract", "Withania somnifera root"). Binomials SHOULD be italicized in body text when context allows (*Lactobacillus acidophilus*); frontmatter and headings stay plain.

* 3.11 Trinomial/subspecies names: genus capitalized; species and subspecies epithets lowercase. Example: "Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis".

* 3.12 Stereochemistry prefixes: `L-`, `D-`, `l-`, `d-`, `cis-`, `trans-`, `R-`, `S-` keep their conventional case and stay hyphenated to the next token. The token following a capitalized prefix is title-cased per CMS ("L-Theanine", "D-Ribose", "cis-9, trans-11 CLA").

* 3.13 Gene and protein symbols: follow field convention, not CMS. Examples: "FOXO4", "mTOR", "p53", "HIF-1α", "NF-κB", "IGF-1". Human gene symbols are all-caps; mouse gene symbols are title-case with the rest lowercase ("Foxo4").

* 3.14 Chemical compound names and IUPAC forms: keep hyphens, numeric locants, and lowercase elements as written ("N-acetylcysteine" in body text, "N-Acetylcysteine" only if it is the canonical_name/short_topic where CMS title-case applies to the word after the prefix).

* 3.15 Every word count in this document excludes HTML comments. They record provenance for the auditor, not content for the reader, and the search statements required in Sections 9–12 are on their own longer than the annotation limits those sections set.



## 4. Glossary Enforcement

* 4.1 Every medical acronym (e.g., DASH, SGLT2, mTOR, AMPK, BUN, CMP, eGFR) includes a plain-language explanation at first use

* 4.2 Every drug class name (e.g., ARB, ACE inhibitor, SGLT2 inhibitor) includes a plain-language explanation at first use

* 4.3 Every biological pathway name (e.g., RAAS, PPAR-γ, mTOR, AMPK) includes a plain-language explanation at first use

* 4.4 Every statistical term (e.g., CI, HR, RR, OR, NNT) includes a plain-language explanation at first use

* 4.5 Every exercise and nutrition term (e.g., Zone 2, DASH, HIIT) includes a plain-language explanation at first use

* 4.6 Every uncommon medical condition or symptom name (e.g., angioedema, rhabdomyolysis, hyperkalemia, orthostatic hypotension) includes a plain-language explanation at first use

* 4.7 Every enzyme and genetic polymorphism (e.g., CYP2C9, UGT1A3, ABCB1, APOE4, MTHFR, and COMT) includes a very short explanation of what the enzyme or gene does at first use

* 4.8 Clinical trial names and brand/product names are NOT given glossary explanations (they are exempt)

* 4.9 Plain-language explanations are brief and in parentheses

* 4.10 First use is determined by reading order (top to bottom); the explanation appears where the term is first encountered, starting at the motivation section.

* 4.11 Frontmatter, title, and "Also known as:" line are exempt from glossary rules

* 4.12 If an acronym first appears inside a table cell, the expansion is provided in a "Context/Notes" column, not crowding the table cell itself


## 5. Hyperlinks

* 5.1 All links are syntactically valid (proper URL format)
* 5.2 All links use standard Markdown syntax: "[text](URL)"
* 5.3 All pipe characters "\|" in markdown link text are replaced with an en-dash "–"

* 5.4 PubMed links use the format "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/PMID/" — not publisher sites (e.g., not ahajournals.org, sciencedirect.com, wiley.com)

* 5.5 No link points to PubMed Central — an article available on PMC is linked by its PubMed ID in the format "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/PMID/"

* 5.6 ClinicalTrials.gov links use the format "https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/<NCT ID>"

* 5.7 DOI links use the format "https://doi.org/<DOI>"

* 5.8 No link points directly to a PDF file. A URL whose path ends in ".pdf" (optionally followed by a query string or fragment) or that serves "application/pdf" is a FAIL. Links must resolve to an HTML landing or abstract page (e.g., the PubMed, DOI, or publisher article page), never a raw PDF download.

`URL verification: Each URL must pass three checks:`

* 5.9 Each URL retrieves the genuine target page

`For PubMed links, use "d-pubmed" ("pubmed_fetch_articles") first: a resolving PMID satisfies this item. If it does not resolve, fall through to the chain below.`

`For ClinicalTrials.gov links, use "d-clinicaltrialsgov" ("clinicaltrials_get_study_record") first: a resolving NCT ID satisfies this item. If it does not resolve, fall through to the chain below.`

`Use "d-browser" to load the URL. If it fails, try "d-fetch". If that also fails, then, if available, try "d-proxy-1", and if that also fails, "d-proxy-2" — bot-wall-defeating retrieval tiers; use whichever page-retrieval tool that server offers. An archive or cache is NOT a retrieval tier and can never satisfy this item. A FAIL is any outcome that is not the genuine target page — a transport error, an error page (404, 403, 500, …), or a bot wall / CAPTCHA / "security checkpoint" interstitial. A page you could not load is not verified.`

* 5.10 The page at each URL contains content matching the link's annotation in the ER (the page is about the cited topic; the article/resource title matches)

* 5.11 Link text that describes a specific study, trial, or finding resolves to that study — not to a reference work, monograph, database entry, or review that merely mentions it. Link text pointing to such a secondary source names it as one (e.g. "a drug monograph", "a systematic review"), never as the primary finding.

* 5.12 No link points to a web archive or cache — web.archive.org, archive.today/archive.ph, or a search-engine cache. If the live URL cannot be retrieved, the link is REMOVED rather than replaced with an archived copy.

`Use "d-browser" or, if it fails, "d-fetch", or, if that also fails, then, if available, "d-proxy-1" and then "d-proxy-2" to read the page, then confirm the content matches the link's description in the ER (e.g., the page is about the cited topic, the article title matches what the ER claims). A generic landing page, paywall, bot wall, or unrelated content fails this check.`

`For PubMed links, the auditor must instead use "d-pubmed" ("pubmed_fetch_articles") to retrieve the article metadata and verify the returned title matches the title claimed in the ER. A mismatch means the PMID was fabricated or assigned to the wrong paper.`

`For ClinicalTrials.gov links, the auditor must instead use "d-clinicaltrialsgov" ("clinicaltrials_get_study_record") to retrieve the study record and verify the study title matches the trial claimed in the ER. A mismatch means the NCT ID was fabricated or assigned to the wrong trial.`



## 6. Frontmatter - Metadata

* 6.1 The document starts with a frontmatter section containing metadata about the document

`Stating what the author received as input for the review creation`

* 6.2 The initial topic used in the prompt to create the review is stated as 'initial_topic: "[initial_topic]"'

`Topic Expansion`

* 6.3 If the [initial_topic] of the evidence review is just a name of a single intervention or a list of interventions (e.g., "Metformin", "Resveratrol & NMN"), the [topic] is stated as "topic: "[initial_topic] for Health & Longevity""

* 6.4 If the [initial_topic] of the evidence review is of the form "[intervention(s)] : [goal]", the [topic] is stated as "topic: "[intervention(s)] to/for/as [goal]" using a fitting preposition (e.g., "Metformin : Skin Rejuvenation" → "Metformin for Skin Rejuvenation")

* 6.5 Otherwise [topic] is stated as 'topic: "[initial_topic]"'

`Normalization & extraction of intervention and goal`

* 6.6 The [topic] of the evidence review is normalized to the form of "[intervention] to/for/as [goal]"

* 6.7 The [intervention] part of the [topic] is stated as "intervention: [intervention]"

* 6.8 The [goal] part of the [topic] is stripped of any preposition and wordiness and stated as "goal: [goal]", e.g., "to Optimize Immune Function" → "Optimize Immune Function", "for Skin Rejuvenation" → "Skin Rejuvenation", "as a Longevity Intervention" → "Longevity"

`Cleaning the intervention and determining variations.`

* 6.9 The [canonical_name] is stated as "canonical_name: [intervention]"
* 6.10 [canonical_name] must not expand [intervention] with synonyms, INN names, or alternate identifiers — even if known. Expansion belongs in alternate_names
* 6.11 The [canonical_name] is simplified and compressed in a way that "and" is replaced by "&", prepositions and wordiness are removed where possible, but the essence is not altered (e.g., "Ivermectin and Mebendazole and Fenbendazole" → " Ivermectin, Mebendazole & Fenbendazole")

* 6.12 [canonical_name] is capitalized following the "Chicago Manual of Style" rules, subject to the scientific-nomenclature overrides in section 3

* 6.13 The [intervention] is inspected and, if multiple variations, names, alternates, synonyms, or spellings exist, all of them, except [canonical_name], are stated as a comma-separated list as "alternate_names: [alternate_names]" (e.g., "Low Dose Naltrexone, LDN, Naltrexone"). Entries are bare names: a brand or abbreviation is its own entry ("Evolocumab, Repatha"), a non-name qualifier is omitted ("(steamed)", "(trans-isomer)"), parentheses inside a chemical name are kept ("Cr(III)")

* 6.14 If [intervention] is a combination, [alternate_names] also lists each agent's own names and abbreviations as separate bare entries (e.g., "Sildenafil, Tadalafil, Atorvastatin, Rosuvastatin"), not only alternates of the combined name

`Reconstructing the topic.`

* 6.15 The [canonical_topic] is stated as "canonical_topic: 'Replacing [intervention] by [canonical_name] in [topic]' (e.g., "LDN to Optimize Immune Function" → "canonical_topic: Low-Dose Naltrexone to Optimize Immune Function")

* 6.16 The [canonical_topic] is simplified in a way that prepositions and wordiness are removed where possible, but the essence is not altered (e.g., "Using a combination of Ivermectin, Mebendazole & Fenbendazole to Fight Cancer" → "Combining Ivermectin, Mebendazole & Fenbendazole to Fight Cancer"). The word "Combining" is never removed — it is essential, not wordiness.

* 6.17 If [intervention] names two or more agents intended to be used together, [canonical_topic] is stated as "Combining [canonical_name] to/for/as [goal]" (e.g., "PDE5 Inhibitors & Statins : Cancer" → "Combining PDE5 Inhibitors & Statins to Treat Cancer"). Any wording in [initial_topic] that marks joint use ("Combined", "Co-administration of", "Using a combination of") is replaced by "Combining". This applies even when the initial topic gave only a bare list.

* 6.18 If the agents are named for comparison rather than joint use, or if [canonical_name] does not itself list the agents (a combination known under a single name, e.g., GlyNAC, ECA, Protandim), "Combining" is not added to [canonical_topic]

* 6.19 [canonical_topic] is capitalized following the "Chicago Manual of Style" rules, subject to the scientific-nomenclature overrides in section 3

`Allowing multiple reviews of the same intervention for different goals. The default goal has no extension. Variations have a one-word extension in parentheses.`

* 6.20 If [goal] is "Health & Longevity" [short_goal] is stated as "short_goal: Longevity".

* 6.21 If [goal] is not "Health & Longevity", a one keyword form of [goal] containing no verb, taken from the words of [goal] itself and never a synonym, is stated as "short_goal: [short_goal]" (e.g., "Optimize Immune Function" → "Immune", "Improve Insulin Sensitivity" → "Insulin", "Support Cardiovascular Health" → "Cardiovascular", "Reduce Inflammation" → "Inflammation", "Skin Rejuvenation" → "Skin", "Muscle Growth" → "Muscle")

* 6.22 If [short_goal] is "Longevity" [short_topic] is stated as "short_topic: [canonical_name]"

* 6.23 If [short_goal] is not "Longevity" [short_topic] is stated as "short_topic: [canonical_name] ([short_goal])" (e.g., "Low-Dose Naltrexone (Immune)", "Metformin (Cancer)")

* 6.24 [short_topic] is capitalized following the "Chicago Manual of Style" rules, subject to the scientific-nomenclature overrides in rule section 3

* 6.25 [short_topic_lc] is stated as "short_topic_lc: ``{[short_topic] converted to lowercase, then consecutive whitespace is collapsed to a single space, then spaces and dashes are replaced with underscores, then any remaining non-alphanumeric, non-underscore characters are removed, then any consecutive underscores are collapsed to a single underscore, then any leading or trailing underscores are stripped}``" (e.g., "Low-Dose Naltrexone (Immune)" → "low_dose_naltrexone_immune", "L-Theanine" → "l_theanine", "EPA & DHA" → "epa_dha", "Ivermectin, Mebendazole & Fenbendazole (Cancer)" → "ivermectin_mebendazole_fenbendazole_cancer")

`AI name & Prompt`

* 6.26 Version of the AI4L.md file used to create the document is stated as "prompt_version: [Version of AI4L.md]"
* 6.27 Creation date and time of the document is stated as "creation_date: [YYYY-MMDD-HHMM]" (e.g., 2026-0501-1430)

* 6.28 The nickname of the AI used to create the document is stated as "creator_ai_nickname: [creator_ai_nickname]"
* 6.29 The nickname of the AI is just a single word model name without version, etc. (e.g., Opus, Sonnet, Grok, Gemini, ChatGPT)

* 6.30 The full name of the AI used to create the document is stated as "creator_ai_fullname: [creator_ai_fullname]"
* 6.31 The full name of the AI consists of the [creator_ai_nickname] and the model version number and no additional qualifier (e.g., Opus 4.6, Sonnet 3.2, Grok 4.5, Gemini 3.1, ChatGPT 5.4)

* 6.32 The knowledge cutoff of the AI is stated as "knowledge_cutoff: [knowledge_cutoff]"

`Filename formatting rules allow for multiple ERs for the same intervention with different goals.`

* 6.33 The filename of the document is stated as "filename: [short_topic_lc]_[creation_date]_[creator_ai_nickname]_ER.md"
 (e.g., "Low-Dose Naltrexone (Immune)" → "low_dose_naltrexone_immune_2026-MMDD-HHMM_creator_ai_nickname_ER.md")

`Cleanliness and consistency of frontmatter values`

* 6.34 All frontmatter values are trimmed: no leading or trailing whitespace, no surrounding quotes unless the value contains a colon, bracket, or leading special character that requires YAML quoting.


## 7. Title

* 7.1 Title is formatted as H1
* 7.2 Title is stated as [canonical_topic]
* 7.3 Title is followed by a line stating `\<section id="top" markdown="1">\</section>`
* 7.4 A next line follows, stating "Evidence Review created on [creation_date reformatted as MM/DD/YYYY] using \[AI4L]\(https://github.com/forever-healthy/AI4L) / [creator_ai_fullname]"
* 7.5 If [alternate_names] exist, a line follows stating "**Also known as:** [alternate_names]" and the line is preceded by a blank line

## 9. Recommended Reading

* 9.1 Section starts with a one-sentence description of its contents

* 9.2 A real-time search was performed for the topic for content that is directly relevant and gives a "high-level" overview of the topic: they discuss the specific topic by name, or its primary mechanism/therapeutic category, in substantial depth

* 9.3 A statement by the author about the search is placed inside an HTML comment

* 9.4 Content is of eligible type: blog posts, podcast episodes, video presentations, YouTube lectures, expert commentary, and qualifying academic articles (primary research, narrative reviews, editorials — NOT systematic reviews or meta-analyses)

* 9.5 Content from the following experts is prioritized (where directly relevant content exists):

 - Rhonda Patrick (foundmyfitness.com)
 - Peter Attia (peterattiamd.com)
 - Andrew Huberman (hubermanlab.com)
 - Chris Kresser (chriskresser.com)
 - Life Extension Magazine (lifeextension.com)
 - Lifespan.io (lifespan.io)

`The auditor must verify that no relevant content from a prioritized expert is overlooked, especially where the ER claims no relevant content was found. Two independent searches are required for each expert:`

`1. Web search: search for "<expert name> <intervention>" using all available web search tools (e.g., the built-in "WebSearch", or an MCP-provided search tool).`

`2. On-site search: use "browser_navigate" to load the expert's platform and search for the intervention directly via the site's own search function, then "browser_snapshot" to read the results.`

`Only after both searches return no relevant results may the auditor confirm the "not found" claim. A brief mention within a broader episode or article still counts as relevant content if it discusses the intervention by name in a health context.`

* 9.6 The following are excluded: Grokipedia, Examine, ConsumerLab content (these have their own dedicated sections)
* 9.7 The following are excluded: Systematic reviews, meta-analyses (these belong in the Systematic Reviews section)
* 9.8 The following are excluded: Encyclopedias, wikis, AI-generated reference sites (e.g., Wikipedia)
* 9.9 The following are excluded: Forums, Reddit threads, community discussion boards, Q&A sites, social media posts
* 9.10 The following are excluded: All mainstream media - TV, print, and radio, including their related online content (e.g., MSNBC, FOX, NYT, WAPO, ...)

* 9.11 The following are excluded: entries in a database, registry, or directory — pages that catalogue a compound or intervention rather than discuss it

* 9.12 Up to 5 items are listed. Every item independently satisfies 9.2 and 9.4 and falls outside the exclusions in 9.6–9.11; neither reaching the count nor an item's presence on a priority platform is itself a justification for inclusion

* 9.13 Where fewer than five qualify, fewer are listed, with a brief explanation visible to the user of why

* 9.14 No more than one item per expert, publication, or organization is included (no duplicates from the same source)

* 9.15 Items are presented in a bulleted list, not a numbered list

* 9.16 The title of each item is linked to the actual article
* 9.17 The title is shown in plain text, not bold text
* 9.18 The title is followed by a reference to the author of the item in the form of " - <author>"
* 9.19 ONLY if no author is available, the publication is used in the form of " - <publication>"

* 9.20 If the item is a scientific paper, the publication year of the paper is included in the form of " - <author>, <year>"

* 9.21 If the item is a scientific paper, the author attribution is an actual person's name or "<last name> et al.", not a journal name, article type descriptor, or organization name

`If uncertain, the auditor must look up the actual author(s) of the linked resource.`

* 9.22 Each link is verified per Section 5 (Loading, Content, Semantics)

`To evaluate 9.22: re-run Section 5 items 5.1 through 5.12 against every link in this section. 9.22 fails if any applicable Section 5 item fails for any link.`

* 9.23 Each item has a 1–2 sentence annotation in a new paragraph explaining its specific value

* 9.24 When an item qualifies via mechanism or therapeutic category (9.2) rather than naming the intervention, the annotation names the shared mechanism or target explicitly (e.g. "the ghrelin receptor GHSR-1a, which GHRP-2 activates").

* 9.25 The new paragraph for the annotation is separated from the title by a blank line

* 9.26 If content from one or more of the priority experts could not be found, a brief note, visible to the user, at the end of the section, explains why

* 9.27 If fewer than 5 high-quality sources could be found, a brief note, visible to the user, explains this, and the list is not padded with marginally relevant content

* 9.28 Each annotation is at most 35 words


## 10. Grokipedia

* 10.1 grokipedia.com was searched directly for the intervention, using the Section 5 retrieval tiers in order until one returns the site's search results
* 10.2 A statement by the author about the search is placed inside an HTML comment, naming the retrieval tiers tried and what each returned

* 10.3 If the document states that no Grokipedia article exists, an independent direct search of grokipedia.com by the auditor confirms that none exists

`The auditor must independently verify the claimed absence by searching grokipedia.com directly, using the same retrieval tiers as Section 5: "d-browser" ("browser_navigate" to load the site's search results for the intervention, then "browser_snapshot" to read them); if d-browser fails, "d-fetch"; if that also fails, "d-proxy-1" and then "d-proxy-2". The item fails only when the auditor retrieves an article the document says does not exist. Absence is confirmed only once every tier has been tried and none returned an article — a failure, error page, or bot wall on one tier is not absence, and where the document cites an article this item is N/A, the link being verified under Section 5 instead.`


* 10.4 If an article exists, a link to the Grokipedia article is provided
* 10.5 Suffixes in the link title, such as " — <sitename>", are removed from the link title

The item fails only when the auditor retrieves an article the document says does not exist. Absence is confirmed only once every tier has been tried and none returned an article — a failure, error page, or bot wall on one tier is not absence, and where the document cites an article this item is N/A, the link being verified under Section 5 instead.`

## 13. Systematic Reviews

* 13.1 A real-time PubMed search was performed for the intervention with "systematic review OR meta-analysis"
* 13.2 Selection was prioritized by citation count (if available), study size, publication date (recent preferred), and relevance

`The auditor must perform an independent PubMed search (e.g., using "pubmed_search_articles") for "systematic review OR meta-analysis" of the intervention to verify that no relevant paper is overlooked.`

* 13.3 If results exist, the section starts with a one-sentence description of its contents
* 13.4 If NO results exist, the one-sentence description of the section's contents is omitted

* 13.5 Up to 5 papers are listed
* 13.6 Papers are presented in a bulleted list, not a numbered list
* 13.7 All papers listed are relevant to the specific intervention being analyzed
* 13.8 All papers listed are actually a systematic review or meta-analysis (not a narrative review or primary study)

* 13.9 Where the intervention involves a trade-off, the listed papers include at least one on the claimed effect and at least one on the principal risk, cost, or forgone benefit, where the literature provides a systematic review or meta-analysis for each. Where it does not, the section states which is unrepresented.

* 13.10 The title of each paper is linked to the paper's PubMed abstract page using the format "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/PMID/"

* 13.11 No links point to publisher websites (e.g., ahajournals.org, sciencedirect.com, wiley.com)

* 13.12 Each link is verified per Section 5 (Loading, Content, Semantics)

* 13.13 The PubMed-retrieved title matches the title in the ER

`The auditor must retrieve the metadata for every PubMed link in this section (e.g., by fetching the PMID or using a PubMed lookup tool) and verify that the title returned by PubMed matches the title stated in the ER. A mismatch means the PMID was fabricated or assigned to the wrong paper.`

* 13.14 The title is shown in plain text, not bold text
* 13.15 The title is followed by a reference to the author(s) and the publication year of the paper
* 13.16 For single-author works "- <last name>, <year>" is used
* 13.17 For dual-author works "- <last name> & <last name>, <year>" is used
* 13.18 For works with more than two authors "- <last name> et al., <year>" is used

`The auditor must verify that each author attribution is an actual person's name, not a journal name, article type descriptor, or organization name. If uncertain, the auditor must look up the actual author(s) of the linked resource.`

* 13.19 Each result has a 1–2 sentence annotation explaining its specific value (in a new paragraph)
* 13.20 The new paragraph for the annotation is separated from the title by a blank line

* 13.21 If no results exist, a statement follows the exact format: "No systematic reviews or meta-analyses for \<intervention> were found on PubMed as of \<current date>."

* 13.22 Each annotation is at most 25 words

* 13.23 If the intervention is a combination and no systematic review or meta-analysis covers the combination, reviews of a single agent may be listed only if the annotation states that the paper is about that agent alone

## 14. Mechanism of Action

* 14.1 The primary biological pathways or mechanisms are explained
* 14.2 The explanation is appropriately concise but sufficient for a non-specialist to understand
* 14.3 Relevant pathway names and acronyms are properly explained per glossary rules
* 14.4 Where competing mechanistic explanations exist for or against the intervention, both are presented
* 14.5 If the intervention is a pharmacological compound, state its key pharmacological properties: half-life, selectivity, tissue distribution, and metabolism (primary pathway and relevant enzymes, e.g., CYP3A4)

* 14.6 If the intervention is a combination, the reason the agents are given together is stated — additive, synergistic, or sequential — and the mechanism of that combined effect is explained

* 14.7 If the intervention is a combination, the pharmacological consequences of co-administration are stated (e.g., a shared metabolic pathway, overlapping half-lives, an additive effect on a shared physiological target)

* 14.8 The mechanism section is 150–250 words


## 15. Historical Context & Evolution

* 15.1 The original intended use of the intervention is discussed
* 15.2 The reasons it came to be considered for health optimization are explained
* 15.3 When historical research is discussed, the actual findings are described — not just the reception or critique of the research
* 15.4 Historical research is not dismissed with labels such as "debunked," "discredited," or "disproven" — the evidence for and against is presented, and the reader can assess the current standing
* 15.5 When describing the evolution of scientific opinion, the section does not frame the current consensus as the final word — it notes what changed and why, including what new evidence emerged on either side
* 15.6 If the section does not apply to the intervention, this is briefly noted

* 15.7 The historical context is 150–250 words


## 16. Expected Benefits

* 16.1 All major known benefits of the intervention are addressed (no significant omissions)

* 16.2 Each item is a distinct outcome. The same outcome is not restated at a different granularity, split by population or endpoint, or repeated under another evidence level; where two items share a mechanism and an endpoint, they are merged.

* 16.3 Content is framed for the target audience (see 1.12), not as population-level outcomes.

* 16.4 A dedicated search for the intervention's complete benefit profile was performed using clinical and expert sources before writing this section. A statement by the author about the search is placed inside an HTML comment at the start of the section.

`The auditor should perform an in-depth search using all available search tools (e.g., the built-in "WebSearch", "pubmed_search_articles", or an MCP-provided search tool) to cross-check and verify that the list of benefits presented in this section is complete, and no benefits have been left unaddressed.`

* 16.5 Each item is assigned a "Level of Evidence" grade
* 16.6 Only the following four levels are used exactly: High, Medium, Low, Speculative
* 16.7 No hybrid or intermediate levels are used (e.g., no "Low-Medium" or "Medium-High")

* 16.8 Items are grouped by evidence level
* 16.9 The groups are presented in the order: High, Medium, Low, Speculative
* 16.10 The group High is presented as "### High 🟩 🟩 🟩"
* 16.11 The group Medium is presented as "### Medium 🟩 🟩"
* 16.12 The group Low is presented as "### Low 🟩"
* 16.13 The group Speculative is presented as "### Speculative 🟨"

* 16.14 The actual item titles are presented in H4
* 16.15 The actual item levels are not shown on a per-item basis

* 16.16 Each item includes an annotation paragraph between the H4 title and the Magnitude line

* 16.17 The annotation is 2–5 sentences and at most 90 words for High and Medium, 50 for Low, 35 for Speculative, covering: what the benefit is, the proposed mechanism (if relevant), the evidence basis (e.g., "meta-analysis of 20 RCTs", "large observational cohort"), and any contextual nuance (limitations, population specifics, conflicting findings)

* 16.18 The annotation is preceded and followed by a blank line
* 16.19 Speculative items also include an annotation; if no controlled studies exist, it notes the basis is mechanistic or anecdotal only

* 16.20 Where evidence is directly conflicted, a "⚠️ Conflicted" flag appears directly after the item name in the title (not in the annotation)
* 16.21 Conflicted evidence is explained in the annotation text. The annotation's last sentence states the net reading of the conflict in one sentence.

* 16.22 If a benefit does not bear on [goal], it carries a "⭕️ Not Central to [goal]" flag directly after the item name in the title (not in the annotation), and the annotation states what it does bear on

* 16.23 Each item (except Speculative) includes a "**Magnitude:** " line giving the first of the following that the literature supports:
  a. an actual outcome as a figure — effect size, absolute or relative risk, prevalence, score change, or change per unit of exposure;
  b. the direction plus the conditions under which it holds (e.g., "prevalence rises steeply above 2 mg/L"), together with a statement that the literature report no outcome figure.
* 16.24 If the literature supports neither, the line begins exactly "**Magnitude:** Not quantified in available studies." and continues with one sentence stating why the literature gives none (e.g., no controlled trial has measured this outcome; only case reports exist)
* 16.25 Items classified as "Speculative" do NOT include a magnitude line
* 16.26 The magnitude line is preceded by a blank line

* 16.27 Each item's evidence grade is appropriate, given the cited studies and data
* 16.28 Each item is verifiable by the sources cited or by independent lookup
* 16.29 Magnitude values are plausible and consistent with known clinical data
* 16.30 No items are overstated relative to their evidence level
* 16.31 No items are understated relative to their evidence level

* 16.32 Each item (except Speculative) cites at least one PubMed link in the item

* 16.33 The evidence level reflects the class of evidence behind the item. High: a human clinical endpoint (symptoms, events, function) or a clinical surrogate validated against outcomes in people (e.g., blood pressure, LDL, HbA1c, bone mineral density, eGFR, a named validated scale), shown in more than one trial. Medium: the same class of outcome in a single trial or in consistent observational data. Low: human data that are uncontrolled, indirect, or conflicting. Speculative: no human outcome data — in-vitro assays, animal work, and unvalidated biomarkers (e.g., MIC or zone assays, MDA, SOD, total antioxidant capacity) cap here regardless of how consistent they are.

`Who was studied belongs in the annotation (16.17), not in the grade. A replicated human HbA1c or blood-pressure finding in a disease population may be High; an MIC, MDA, SOD, or "total antioxidant capacity" finding is Speculative.`

* 16.34 All four evidence-level headings (High, Medium, Low, Speculative) are present, in that order. A level with no items still carries the heading. An empty High or Medium is followed by one sentence naming the class of evidence that falls short; an empty Low or Speculative carries the heading alone. That sentence is not an H4 item and has no Magnitude line.

`Example: "No benefit reaches High: the human trials are small uncontrolled series, and the antimicrobial data are in-vitro MIC assays." A missing heading is a fail even when the skip is justified. A because-line that only says evidence is limited, without naming the evidence class, is a fail.`

* 16.35 If the intervention is a combination, each item states whether the cited evidence tested the combination or only one of its agents, naming the agent. A benefit established for one agent is delivered by the combination and keeps the grade its evidence supports. A claim that the combination achieves more than either agent alone rests on evidence testing the two together and is graded on that evidence.


## 17. Benefit-Modifying Factors

* 17.1 Genetic polymorphisms that may modify benefits are discussed where relevant (e.g., variants affecting drug transport, metabolism, or disease susceptibility)
* 17.2 Baseline biomarker levels are discussed as a factor influencing benefits
* 17.3 Known sex-based differences in benefits are discussed
* 17.4 Pre-existing health conditions that may influence benefits are discussed
* 17.5 Age-related considerations are discussed (including for those at the older end of the target range)
* 17.6 Each factor is presented as a bulleted item with a short bold label followed by a descriptive explanation

* 17.7 If none of the above is relevant to the intervention, it is briefly stated

* 17.8 Each factor is at most 45 words


## 18. Potential Risks & Side Effects

* 18.1 All major known risks and side effects of the intervention are addressed (no significant omissions). For a combination, this includes risks arising only from co-administration
* 18.2 Each item is a distinct outcome. The same outcome is not restated at a different granularity, split by population or endpoint, or repeated under another evidence level; where two items share a mechanism and an endpoint, they are merged.

* 18.3 Content is framed for the target audience (see 1.12), not as population-level outcomes.

* 18.4 A dedicated search for the intervention's complete side effect profile was performed using a drug reference source (e.g., prescribing information, drugs.com, Mayo Clinic) before writing this section. A statement by the author about the search is placed inside an HTML comment at the start of the section.

`The auditor should perform an in-depth search using all available search tools (e.g., the built-in "WebSearch", "pubmed_search_articles", or an MCP-provided search tool) to cross-check and verify that the list of risks and side effects presented in this section is complete, and no risks or side effects have been left unaddressed.`

* 18.5 Each item is assigned a "Level of Evidence" grade
* 18.6 Only the following four levels are used exactly: High, Medium, Low, Speculative
* 18.7 No hybrid or intermediate levels are used (e.g., no "Low-Medium" or "Medium-High")

* 18.8 Items are grouped by evidence level
* 18.9 The groups are presented in the order: High, Medium, Low, Speculative
* 18.10 The group High is presented as "### High 🟥 🟥 🟥"
* 18.11 The group Medium is presented as "### Medium 🟥 🟥"
* 18.12 The group Low is presented as "### Low 🟥"
* 18.13 The group Speculative is presented as "### Speculative 🟨"

* 18.14 The actual item titles are presented in H4
* 18.15 The actual item levels are not shown on a per-item basis

* 18.16 Each item includes an annotation paragraph between the H4 title and the Magnitude line

* 18.17 The annotation is 2–5 sentences and at most 90 words for High and Medium, 50 for Low, 35 for Speculative, covering: what the risk is, the proposed mechanism (if known), the evidence basis (e.g., "clinical trials", "FDA information", "post-marketing reports"), and any contextual nuance (severity, reversibility, at-risk populations, comparison to other agents in the class)

* 18.18 The annotation is preceded and followed by a blank line
* 18.19 Speculative items also include an annotation; if no controlled data exist, it notes the basis is mechanistic or from isolated reports

* 18.20 Where evidence is directly conflicted, a "⚠️ Conflicted" flag appears directly after the item name in the title (not in the annotation)
* 18.21 Conflicted evidence is explained in the annotation text. The annotation's last sentence states the net reading of the conflict in one sentence.

* 18.22 Each item (except Speculative) includes a "**Magnitude:** " line giving the first of the following that the literature supports:
  a. an actual outcome as a figure — effect size, absolute or relative risk, prevalence, score change, or change per unit of exposure;
  b. the direction plus the conditions under which it holds (e.g., "prevalence rises steeply above 2 mg/L"), together with a statement that the literature report no outcome figure.
* 18.23 If the literature supports neither, the line begins exactly "**Magnitude:** Not quantified in available studies." and continues with one sentence stating why the literature gives none (e.g., no controlled trial has measured this outcome; only case reports exist)
* 18.24 Items classified as "Speculative" do NOT include a magnitude line
* 18.25 The magnitude line is preceded by a blank line

* 18.26 Each item's evidence grade is appropriate given the cited studies and data
* 18.27 Each item is verifiable by the sources cited or by independent lookup
* 18.28 Magnitude values are plausible and consistent with known clinical data
* 18.29 No items are overstated relative to their evidence level
* 18.30 No items are understated relative to their evidence level

* 18.31 Each item (except Speculative) cites at least one PubMed link in the item

* 18.32 The evidence level reflects the class of evidence behind the item. High: a human clinical endpoint (symptoms, events, function, documented adverse events) or a clinical surrogate validated against outcomes in people (e.g., blood pressure, LDL, HbA1c, bone mineral density, eGFR, a named validated scale), shown in more than one trial. Medium: the same class of outcome in a single trial or in consistent observational data. Low: human data that are uncontrolled, indirect, or conflicting. Speculative: no human outcome data — in-vitro cytotoxicity, animal work, and unvalidated biomarkers cap here regardless of how consistent they are.

`Who was studied belongs in the annotation (18.17), not in the grade. A replicated human adverse-event finding in a disease population may be High; an in-vitro cytotoxicity or unvalidated biomarker shift is Speculative.`

* 18.33 All four evidence-level headings (High, Medium, Low, Speculative) are present, in that order. A level with no items still carries the heading. An empty High or Medium is followed by one sentence naming the class of evidence that falls short; an empty Low or Speculative carries the heading alone. That sentence is not an H4 item and has no Magnitude line.

`A missing heading is a fail even when the skip is justified. A because-line that only says evidence is limited, without naming the evidence class, is a fail.`

* 18.34 If the intervention is a combination, each item states whether the cited evidence tested the combination or only one of its agents, naming the agent. A risk established for one agent is carried by the combination and keeps the grade its evidence supports. A claim that the combination is riskier than either agent alone rests on evidence testing the two together and is graded on that evidence.

* 20.9 If a mitigating action is known (dose reduction, timing separation, monitoring schedule), it is stated

* 20.10 Populations to avoid include specific thresholds or classifications where applicable (e.g., "recent MI (<90 days)", "Child-Pugh Class C", "NYHA Class IV") — not only general categories

## 29. Conclusion

* 29.1 The conclusion is a cohesive summary of the document as a whole
* 29.2 It is framed for the target audience (see 1.12)
* 29.3 It reflects what the intervention is, the main benefits, the main risks and considerations
* 29.4 It reflects on the overall quality of the evidence base (including any conflicts of interest per 2.8–2.10)

* 29.5 It is 150–250 words
* 29.6 It is consistent with the evidence levels assigned in the Benefits and Risks sections
* 29.7 Where evidence is uncertain, the conclusion conveys that uncertainty

* 29.8 It DOES NOT introduce new evidence or claims not previously discussed
* 29.9 It DOES NOT use acronyms that would require glossary expansion or technical classifications that require specialist knowledge, uses plain-language terms instead

`For the conclusion section, the test is not whether a word looks technical, but whether a non-specialist would use it unprompted and know its exact meaning — this also catches ordinary-looking clinical-register words (e.g., "adjunct" → "add-on", "hormetic" → "brief beneficial stress", "potentiate" → "strengthen", "modality" →  "type/method").`

* 29.10 It DOES NOT cite specific trials (names, years, sample sizes, p-values)
* 29.11 It DOES NOT cite effect sizes, relative risks, or statistical results

* 29.12 It DOES NOT use prescriptive or advisory language — it summarizes evidence, not what anyone should do
* 29.13 It DOES NOT address the reader directly

* 29.14 It DOES NOT force a pro-vs-con structure or equal treatment of competing positions
* 29.15 It DOES NOT state what further evidence is needed or what should be done
* 29.16 It DOES NOT frame its takeaway around an average-risk or general population
* 29.17 It DOES NOT close on generic cautions that apply to a population the reader is not part of
* 29.18 It DOES NOT characterize any position on the intervention as the accepted, mainstream, or settled view
* 29.19 It DOES NOT frame one position as the default and the other as requiring extra justification

* 29.20 The conclusion section ends with a line stating "**\[Top]\(#top) - \[Benefits]\(#expected-benefits) - \[Risks]\(#potential-risks--side-effects) - \[Protocol]\(#therapeutic-protocol)**"
* 29.21 The ending line is preceded by a blank line

`The checklist items for the motivation section are the last items in the checklist, but the motivation section itself is the first section of the document. This is due to the motivation section should be written last, after all other sections are completed, to ensure it accurately reflects the full scope of the review.`

## 30. Motivation

* 30.1 The motivation section is located after the title and frontmatter but before all other sections
* 30.2 A statement by the author that the section was only written after the rest of the document was written to have the full scope of the topic is placed inside an HTML comment

* 30.4 The section covers the essential aspects of the topic
* 30.5 The section is a concise, accessible introduction
* 30.6 The purpose and focus of the document are clearly explained
* 30.7 The motivation does NOT jump to conclusions or preempt the analysis results
* 30.8 The motivation does NOT state or imply the direction of any result (e.g., "matched", "outperformed", "reduced", "caused fewer side effects", "linked to better…"), with or without numbers
* 30.9 The motivation does NOT characterize any position on the intervention as the accepted, mainstream, or settled view — it presents the debate neutrally

* 30.10 Where relevant, the motivation connects the intervention to the health and longevity lens of the target audience (see 1.12)

* 30.11 The motivation consists of three paragraphs
* 30.12 First paragraph explains in plain language what the intervention is and why it is of interest
* 30.13 Second paragraph gives additional context — e.g., historical use, prevalence, or a single headline finding that motivates the review — stated as what was studied or why it drew interest, never as its outcome
* 30.14 The final paragraph is a crisp statement of what this review examines and why
* 30.15 The final paragraph does not use evaluative or advisory language — it states what the review
  examines, not what anyone should do

* 30.16 The motivation is 150–200 words

* 30.17 DOES NOT use acronyms that would require glossary expansion or technical classifications that require specialist knowledge, uses plain-language terms instead

`For the motivation section, the test is not whether a word looks technical, but whether a non-specialist would use it unprompted and know its exact meaning — this also catches ordinary-looking clinical-register words (e.g., "adjunct" → "add-on", "hormetic" → "brief beneficial stress", "potentiate" → "strengthen", "modality" →  "type/method").`

* 30.18 DOES NOT parenthetically define standard terms (e.g., "CRP (C-reactive protein, a general marker of systemic inflammation)")

* 30.20 DOES NOT cite specific trials (names, years, sample sizes, p-values)
* 30.21 DOES NOT cite effect sizes, relative risks, or statistical results
* 30.22 DOES NOT contain exhaustive mechanism-of-action descriptions; a single sentence on the primary mechanism is sufficient
* 30.23 DOES NOT list every health domain the intervention touches, mentions the most notable 2–3 at most
* 30.24 DOES NOT mention specific influencers, podcasters, or biohackers (e.g., "Peter Attia recommends…")

* 30.25 The motivation section ends with a line stating "**\[Benefits]\(#expected-benefits) - \[Risks]\(#potential-risks--side-effects) - \[Protocol]\(#therapeutic-protocol) - \[Conclusion]\(#conclusion)**"
* 30.26 The ending line is preceded by a blank line
