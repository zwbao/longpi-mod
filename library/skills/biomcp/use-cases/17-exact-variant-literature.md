# Pattern: Exact-variant literature retrieval

Use this when you have a complete gene plus protein change and need a compact, evidence-first literature shortlist without making a clinical classification.

```bash
biomcp search variant MSH2 p.L341P --limit 5
biomcp variant articles "MSH2 p.L341P" --limit 5
biomcp batch article 26951660,31433521 --mode compact
biomcp get article 26951660 fulltext
biomcp --json get article 26951660 assets
biomcp article citations 26951660 --limit 5
biomcp article references 26951660 --limit 5
```

For an assembly-aware one-item request, save `[{"request_id":"atm-grch38","gene":"ATM","transcript":"NM_000051.4","coding":"c.1066-6T>G","accession":"NC_000011.10","build":"GRCh38","position":108248927,"ref":"T","alt":"G"}]` as `variants.json`, then run `biomcp --json variant articles --input variants.json`.

Interpretation:
- Resolve the strict identity first; do not treat a search spelling as a normalized result.
- `caller_supplied` means BioMCP accepted the supplied fields as one caller assertion; it validated syntax but did not establish cross-coordinate equivalence.
- `provider_confirmed` means MyVariant uniquely confirmed the request; otherwise inspect `provider_validation` for `not_found`, `indeterminate`, `contradictory`, or `unavailable` and its nullable matched alias or contradictory field.
- RefSeq exact work starts with caller-present transcript/coding, gene/coding, and genomic aliases. When separately supplied versioned RefSeq transcript/coding and genomic/build identities agree through CAR, `canonical_equivalence` records additive CAid evidence; confirmed CAR aliases may fill unused retrieval slots without altering resolution, with no liftover or article-evidence claim.
- Use the union shortlist, compare summaries in one batch, request full text/assets only for selected papers, and expand citations or references only when needed. `provenance.query_aliases` is a retrieval input, not evidence that a paper contains the alias; inspect `--debug-plan` for strict and discovery requests. For a conservative captured-evidence pass, run `biomcp --json variant articles "MSH2 p.L341P" --verify-identity --confirmed-only`. Verification occurs before ranking and pagination, and confirms from either a returned-PMID typed PubTator Gene/Variant linkage whose exact HGVS and CorrespondingGene/NCBI Gene-ID facts agree, or an optional bounded ClinGen LDH annotation binding an applicable CAid, requested gene, known PMCID, and exact text/table selector. LDH observes only retrieved candidates: absent coverage is not negative evidence. `identity.observations` records provider, locator, linked gene, observed alias, typed `provider_linkage`, and captured-content hash; an absent or incomplete observation is not confirmation. The debug artifact hashes are versioned clinically relevant response/content audit facts, never retrieval-cache keys or query aliases, and verification does not fetch supplements automatically. Incomplete verification remains truncated with no total; frozen fixtures are release proof, while live probes are diagnostics.
